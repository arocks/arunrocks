<h1> Welcome to ArunRocks! </h1>
<p> Many eons ago, there was a little page on Geocities with a yellow sign that resembled a construction worker digging. It had the proud title that was happened to be the better one among the automatic suggestions - 'Arun Rocks'. From such humble beginning, ArunRocks.com has evolved several times to what you see today. </p>

<p> Over here you will find pages filled with elegant code, fun games, visual treats and lots of idle musings. Your host, Arun Ravindran, loves to tinker with computers ever since he fell in love with an IBM PC in 1990. He is an IT business analyst by day and a very friendly programming geek otherwise. Every page you see here was carefully prepared on moonlit nights over a cup of pipping hot tea.</p>

<p>If you find his posts interesting, don't forget to drop a comment or two. Even better, <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/Arunrocks">subscribe to his feed.</a> </p>
