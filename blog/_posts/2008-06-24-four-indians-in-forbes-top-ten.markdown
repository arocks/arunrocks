I noticed that four out of the ten richest people are now Indians. Is this is a sign of India's growing economic power? Is this an indicator of the overall economic disparity in the country? Has this happened before? Am I asking too many pointless questions? Maybe.

Here is the billionaires list from [Forbes website](http://www.forbes.com/lists/2008/10/billionaires08_The-Worlds-Billionaires_Rank.html) as of today:

The [list features many Indians](http://www.forbes.com/lists/2008/10/billionaires08_The-Worlds-Billionaires_CountryOfPrmRes_10.html) like Nandan and Azim Premji. Hope this is a growing trend  :wink:
