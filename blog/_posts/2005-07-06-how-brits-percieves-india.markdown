The image of a typical Indian around the world is increasingly changing to that of a singing, dancing, romancing and festival loving person. Thanks to Bollywood movies, India is perceived through its celluloid dreams, just like once we conceived the West through Hollywood. Perhaps as a testament to that, the following cheeky poster campaign by [Kingfisher][1] is being increasingly spotted in Central London. There are others in similar lines, which reminds you of the bright traditional Indian ads.

Last week, I came to know that the smart phone I was planning for all along Â– [Sendo X2][2] might never get released at all. Due to [administration problems][3], the company has been taken over by Motorola. Sendo X2 which was expected this month seems to have been shelved indefinitely. Not that I'm dying for a smart phone (which I feel is quite inadequate given today's technology). But I definitely miss a jazzy looking music player ;-)
