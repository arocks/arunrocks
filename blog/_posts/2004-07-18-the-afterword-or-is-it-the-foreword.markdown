I guess you can say the honeymoon period is over. In a wild goose chase that spanned over 3 DCs and many, many overnight bus journeys; I could have sensed something was happening. After nearly 6 weeks of ES University and many man-days later, when the wait seemed despairingly long, it finally came. Yes, the project I had been waiting for. About which I knew only three simple letters: U-B-S. But those three letters stood for the Trinity or the Thrimoorthis or the rather the undying quest for truth itself.

If you think I'm hyping you up, consider the facts. Among all the four projects considered for me. This is the only one that has:

1.  Any connection to finance whatsoever. And boy, the connection is real solid. UBS is a Swiss bank and the second largest bank in the world
2.  Only project which is starting from scratch. I get benefit of seeing the whole picture
3.  No maintenance/support stuff here. It is a true <b>consulting</b> assignment with technical architecture designing. I get to see what I designed as a living, breathing system in UBS!
4.  Opportunity for client interaction in my very first project
5.  The only architecture I'm familiar with inside out is Microsoft platform. This project uses Microsoft BizTalk
6.  The other thing I have risked to learn in TAPMI other than finance is German. I couldn't ever convince myself for paying for German classes. But guess what, I'll be in Switzerland, where German is very crucial to interact with clients.

The deal was not even inked when I was identified for it, but it came though. But, the excitement is really chilling for at least two reasons. Firstly, I'm might be too optimistic about the whole thing and I'm in for major disappointment later. Secondly, the responsibility is huge, it is a make-or-break situation. I have to really, really prove myself in this using a combination of my skills.

But I still prefer to see the bright side. In my brief tenure in the company, I've been surprising myself at my own agility. The agonizing decisions I've taken purely based on my gut feel, proved that I'm different from the bandwagon and rightfully so. The gift of serendipity to meet true and inspiring friends who just by a few interactions could enhance a facet of my life. Their rewarding companionship and support will take me I'm sure to where I belong.

Everywhere I traveled I felt every place will be your home; in fact, you need to just feel it. The structures, the roads, the streets names, the people are mere multiple facades to very same abode - Home. This is the religion of the global traveler, that - this is my global village. And guess what the religion just got a new believer :-)
