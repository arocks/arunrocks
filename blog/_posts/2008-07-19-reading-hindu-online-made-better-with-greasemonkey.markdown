**Note this currently works only if you have Firefox installed**

[The Hindu](http://www.thehindu.com/) is is one of the newspapers I have great respect for. I am allergetic to fresh newsprint, so I have no choice but to read their online edition even if I have subscribed to the print edition. But their website badly needs a redesign. However, in this Web2.0 era you are not at the mercy of the site admins to do something about it. *You* can improve your browsing experience in 2 steps:

1. Point your firefox to the [Greasemonkey add-on](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/748) page and install the add-on. Now restart Firefox before you go to step 2. Don't worry all your open tabs will be restored.

2. Go to the [Hindu Printer Redirect Script](http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/30273) and click on the **Install this Script** button

Voila, start browsing Hindu, for example [this page](http://www.hindu.com/2008/07/19/01hdline.htm) and enjoy the difference!
