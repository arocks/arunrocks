Hi All,

Yesterday, one of the most unexpected things happened. I got a mail from Mr. Narayana Murthy himself! It was a reply to a birthday greeting I'd sent. I have reproduced it below

<span style="font-size:+0;">(His email id is altered for obvious reasons). Cool, isnt it? For those who have been following my blog, here comes a shocker. I'm on a transfer to Pune DC from Monday for 3 months. Yep, I'm still in the same project and the reasons are purely technical, but bothersome nonetheless. There are hundreds of things to do and I have started to jot down the first few atleast.</span>

The Onam celebrations are going on in full glory in Mangalore and Trivandrum DCs of Infosys. Considering the main day (thiru onam) is on 28th, it would have been exciting to be there at this time. Well, all I can go is flip through those colourful snaps.

<a href="http://www.karthik82.org">Karthik</a> seems to be continuing the work we had started with the <a href="http://www.tapmi.org">TAPMI</a> intranet portal. In many ways the vision (of Punit, Prof Sankran and me) of having a collaborative learning environment in TAPMI is still a long way to go. But as this shows, it is still alive.

Ok, time for some technical stuff. As I had promised I would give a brief intro to <a href="http://www.sodipodi.com/">Sodipodi</a> and <a href="http://www.gimp.org/">Gimp</a>. Sodipodi is a widely used vector drawing program. To see how widely used, take some time to visit sodipodi.org's gallery. You would find most of the familiar open source logos here. Some of the uses of Sodipodi would be designing icons, logos and banner. I'm planning to use it in big way in designing my site. However Sodipodi's export module is not yet stable in Windows. Hence I have to resort to GIMP, which seems to be not fully compatible.

The future of icon designing is vector based than pixel based, hence tools like Sodipodi have already gained currency among icon designers. Unfortunately, the promise of "scalable to any resolution" is misleading. Like truetype fonts, there should be various vector paths that are turned off at lower resolutions and vice versa. This problem which has been largely solved by font designer should be taken up by icon designers as well.<!--4357d02396ab31d8d6efad32c2a81494-->
