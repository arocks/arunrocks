This weekend, I was humbled in more ways than one. First while
visiting the [London Science Museum][1], when one gets to see a spell
binding display of the relentless scientific pursuits of Man. Despite
spending a good 2 hours inside, we barely managed to cover the ground
floor of this five storied treasure house of knowledge. And second,
when I realised that, whenever one feels financially complacent; pay a
visit to [Harrods][2] and you'll swear never to use the expression
"over-priced" in your life.

Harrods is the world's most recognised department store spread over
*five acres* right in the heart of London. Here you can see heaps of
well earned money frittered over the most trivial or sometimes futile
purchases. Like for e.g. in a "Sale" a pen for £250 (twice the price
of a mid-range digital cameras) or a coffee table with a chess board
print (not even carved) for £10,000. However, what would probably
surprise you is - simply, the crowd. Yes, hundreds of rooms filled
with buyers busy filling up their umpteenth green 'Harrods' shopping
bag. If you hadn't noticed the price tags, this would have passed for
an ordinary departmental store.

Few minutes later, you look around. Your fears get confirmed. You are
indeed the only person who is *not* shopping. So, I decide; while I'm
here, I better observe the ways and manners of the elite. Most
disappointingly, they look exactly like the ordinary London
milieu. Most of them in casuals like sneakers (horror!) and jeans. Yes
my friends you have to look out for subtle giveaways like designer
labels or rolex watches to spot the real cash puppies. Hints that
never escape the sharp eyes of the shop assistants. So, if you are the
right crowd, you'll perhaps be treated like a prince (most probably
you are already one;) ). But I'm far from one, so...

The next planned destination - Hyde park, was sealed due to the
[Live8][3] concert. Though a major event here, the whole idea seemed
shallow and pointless to me. In fact, it was not even a fund raising
event like 'Live Aid'. People seemed to have watched the whole 12 hour
show and stayed up most of the night. In fact, I did stay up too, but
for my game project :D Was fighting some Ogre-Blender related issues,
but I got my issues solved thanks to the excellent [Ogre3d][4]
support. Yet another day is saved, thanks to the excellent support of
open-source projects :).
