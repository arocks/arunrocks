Sony Bravia CX 420 - a TV for those who hate TV channel

We were on the lookout for a flat screen LCD TV for a while. Actually, for me every gadget purchase takes 'a while' due to the amount of research I generally do. Since, I do not watch TV regularly, I had to practically learn all the TV jargon from scratch.

After a month of 'superficial research', I realised the following:

* The old CRT TV is completely out of the market. You might be able to find, at best, a 21" CRT TV.
* There are no plasma TVs in the 32" category. They only come in bigger sizes and guzzle a lot of power.
* The market leader in Indian TV market is Samsung followed by LG. The Koreans also dominate the world market this way with low cost yet high quality TV sets.
* LED screens are a gimmick. It's just LED backlighting and true LED TVs are a few years away from an average consumer's reach. Their saturated colors in the showroom is just clever tweaking.
* 32" is a reasonably large screen for our apartment living room. Any bigger and you will feel you are literally inside the screen. :)
* The higher end TVs have higher frame rates for sports action. This is called by different manufacturers by different names such as Tru Motion or Flo motion. This is very annoying while watching movies as it makes them look like TV serials. This might not be perceptible to many, but personally I couldn't watch my favourite movies being 'interpolated' this way
* In most modern TVs, there is no need for a DVD or bluray player if you prefer to keep movies in your pen drive or hard disk. You can simply plug in the device directly to your TV set. The video will play if the file format is supported by your TV.
* No comments on 3D TV as it's obviously not a requirement for us.


All these are the facts, I could gather from the Internet. I also visited a couple of stores in April and found out that only LG offered IPS displays among the leading brands. Now, I know a thing or two about IPS displays because it is the same technology used on Apple Cinema displays. 

IPS displays have the widest viewing angles and excellent color reproduction. In fact, I was so impressed by IPS displays that I own a 23" DELL IPS monitor. So I was almost certain to buy an LG.

Around May this year, LG did a refresh of their lineup of TV screens. They no longer offered IPS displays in their 32 inch screens. This was extremely disappointing as this meant that I have to visit the stores again to view and evaluate the sets.

Visits to the nearest Samsung and LG showrooms resulted in quite a bit of disappointment. Their 32" LCD models were a shadow of their predecessors. The color reproduction was weak. The sound appeared to come out of a closed box. The sales representatives were not very clear in explaining the "improvements" such as why LG decided to abandon the IPS display. I was even tempted to buy an older CRT instead!

We then visited the Girias outlet near our apartment, from where we have made most of our purchases. The sales representative was quite patient and knowledgeable. He explained that the non-IPS displays have been improving in the past couple of years and the color reproduction was almost at par.

When I explained to him that I found the LG and Samsung audio and video quality was not satisfactory, he demoed a Sony Bravia model - CX 420. Now, personally I detest the brand Sony due to their tendency to create their own standards like the Memory stick, Betamax and UMD. Also, they charge premium rates for the same feature set just for their brand name especially in laptops. Besides the number 420 does ring a bell in India :)

But I was genuinely surprised when the model actually had better picture quality, color reproduction and excellent sound (with bass) for a price premium of 3K. However, most impressive was the huge amount of video and audio formats that the set supported out of the box. Even today there are TVs that support pen drives but not harddisks or ones that play .avi but not .mkv videos. But this 420 could play virtually any type of file lying in my harddisk except for any audio with 5.1 channels (because, duh, it had only 2 speakers).

After some bargaining, I got this model for 35k. Once home, we wall-mounted the unit and now its almost like a colourful window in the living room :). Interestingly, we found ourselves spending more time watching movies from the hard-disks (yes plural, I have quite a collection :) ) rather than watching boring television programmes. Couldn't be happier!

### Unpacking / Appearance 

Unlike the TVs of yoke, today's TV boxes can be carried by one person. The box contains a stand if you are mounting on a flat surface. The assembly takes about 10 mins and the written instructions are quite clear. Wall mounting would need additional screws so it's best that you ask the Sony personnel to wall-mount at no additional cost.

The TV is a classy all-black model a slightly glossy bevel. However the screen is, thankfully, matte. The steroe speakers are located at the bottom. The remote is quite long and slender. It is quite easy to hold and the button are well laid out.
