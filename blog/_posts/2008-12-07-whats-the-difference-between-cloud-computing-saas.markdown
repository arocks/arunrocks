Q. What's the Difference between Cloud Computing & SaaS?

A. It is the same as the difference between TV and Cable TV. TV is a technology. However, Cable TV is a business model using this technology.

Cloud Computing refers to an architecture where web applications can scale easily to any number of users. Software as a Service (SaaS) is a business model where computing software is provided in a 'pay as you use' model. SaaS is often built using Cloud Computing. But all Cloud Computing apps don't use the SaaS model.

Therefore Cloud Computing != SaaS
