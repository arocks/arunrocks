<h1> About Me </h1>

<p> My name is Arun Ravindran. I am a techie, husband and an open source enthusiast in Bangalore, India. I work for <a href="http://www.infosys.com/">Infosys Ltd</a> as a Business Analyst in the Finance domain. Please check my <a href="/downloads/resume.pdf">Resume [PDF]</a> for more details.

<p> If you would like to get in touch with me, please message me on <a href="http://twitter.com/arocks">twitter</a>.

<h2> Colophon </h2>

<p> This site was created in
beautiful <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/">HTML5</a>
markup. Seriously, just check the source! All blog posts are written
using <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>,
and then <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll#readme">Jekyll</a>
converts it into a static site. The site source code has been <a href="https://github.com/arocks/arunrocks">open sourced</a>.

All custom fonts are from Google Fonts. Headings use the Arvo font by Anton Koovit. The drawings and mockups were created in <a href="http://inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a> and later exported to <a href="http://www.gimp.org/">Gimp</a>. Header animation was created using CSS3.
