Here is a belated valentine's day greeting from both of us.

For all my readers, I recommend visiting the [microsite](http://www.arunrocks.com/wedding/) I had made earlier. Now it is written entirely in [web.py](http://webpy.org/). Thanks to my new website host, [A Small Orange](http://refer.asmallorange.com/15934), I can create and host python based applications. I agree that there is no need to design a new blog in python again, but it is a great way to learn a new (anti-) framework. Web.py applications are really small and easy to understand and [therefore, has less bugs](http://www.paulgraham.com/head.html).

Guess what, [Jeff Atwood owns an ASUS](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000624.html) laptop model (W3J) that is similar to [mine](http://www.flickr.com/photos/arun_ravindran/2215166942/) (F3J). He is full of praise about the decision. Considering I took at least 2 months (the standard duration for yours truly to zero into an buying decision) to arrive at the decision, it seems well worth now :).
