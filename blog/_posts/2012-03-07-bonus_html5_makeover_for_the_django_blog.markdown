Thank you for the great feedback on my first screencast about [building a blog in Django 1.3][sc1]. A lot of people told me that they found the video helpful in understanding what Django is capable of.

As promised earlier, I have recorded a short video (7 mins) that explains how you can use an HTML5 template to improve the appearance of your blog. You can use any free template or create your own. 

Django's (version 1.3) static files app is being used here. Unlike prior versions, there are no changes to `urls.py` required here. Linking to the admin site is also demonstrated.

It is best to watch it directly at [Youtube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dbAIuDVyFc&hd=1) in HD. 

__UPDATE:__ The blog with the updated template has been uploaded to [github](https://github.com/arocks/django-blog-html5)
