It was a really exciting day today. It couldn't have been at a better place than Bangalore Infosys, the very birthplace of this famous company! I met my delivery manager Abhishek and had a nice conversation with him. If his idea was to drive me, it worked!!! He also kind of liked my suggestions. I also met a senior consultant Rakesh who was so crystal in his concepts that the session was an eye-opener in EAI! He said I could pursue my research in <em>EAI Patterns</em> if I wished. Sounded good to me :). Tday for the first time at work I got a lot of action items, including applying for my visa to UK and Aus. So I felt real good.<br /><br />I met a lot of people other than that. They had a interesting thing about them... they wanted to do or go exactly where *I* wanted to. For eg: I wanted to find a block, the person would need to go to the sanme block for something else. These weird coincidences happened 4 or 5 times throughout the day!! I met a lot, I mean a lot of ESU guys and many of them were pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />I shifted from the main guest house at Adarsh Gardens to a smaller one called Saptagiri. It is more like a small house with a nice mix of resident. Purohit from CCD Calif, his wife and daughter was the first I could meet. Very friendly and sweet family. I met an young Aussie named Brad and he was very conversant. Later I met the remaining occupant another Aussie named Mark. Brad was finding it hard to adjust with Indian food and water, coz of "all the bugs". He is planning a 3 week trip all over India, of course, including Kerala before leaving for Australia.<br /><br />My junies mailed me that they are missing me!!! I was in systems committee and it was the underdog. Now it seems it has assumed a prominent position. My portal and the software I'd developed will be used as "TAPMI Intranet" portal. More importantly professors are after it as a learning tool, exactly as I had envisaged. Aint it cool?<br /><br />So looks like I'll be here till sunday, thats plenty of time to roam about this Garden City. This is turning out to be one random decision that I'll never regret.
