### Epic

'Tis their chase littered with unending corpses  
'Tis a dogged race with the savages of Norse's  
I've slain them again and again  
Still their shadows circle us from bloody skies  
Fire breathing dragons like Satan's kites  
  
Fragrance of jasmine from her lovely tresses  
Mixes odours with the rotting carcasses  
Her warm breath behind my neck  
Holding me tight, her lips part ways  
Fear not, I comfort with resolute gaze  
  
A deranged one dives with burning eyes  
Unsheathing the sword over the precipice  
Life plays a ghastly roll of the dice  
A swift evasion and a mighty sweep  
A dismembered head shrieks over the heap  
  
On the handle of my sword my fingers tightened  
She held me tight, lithe arms wrapped from behind  
Her lovely countenance rests lightly on me  
My palm placed on hers, my mind easen  
My steed gallops gently towards the horizon
