Bhute coming over signifies the formation of a wolf-pack. Both of us have the same child-like curiosity and spirit of adventure. Blessed with amazing resonance in our mental wavelengths, this sparse pack can scale peaks and cross choppy seas. I knew this even before he came, and I'm sure he did too.

So the shelved Scotland plan was revived; Ankur 03 joined the pack and with conspicuous lack of planning we set forth. Onwards to Edinburg, I met a couple from my hometown. When Allet was not busy giving me cautionary tips on living (or rather settling?) in this country, his little girl seemed to have found a friend in me. I dunno if I have mentioned this somewhere before, but kids get along with me quite well. Even infant teribles have incredibly calmed down in my arms:cool:. Enough ranting! We also played Antakshiri for about 3 hours on the way. It was pure fun!

Jitu left our project on 18th.
