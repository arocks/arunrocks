Here is a recipe I wish I had when I was learning to cook. For the
benefit of all the Indian bachelors who are gonna start cooking, I give
you - a lifesaver:


### How to make Pulaaaaaoooooo

Or

### Idiot's Guide to Homely Indian Food

Since I'm going to teach you this ultra cool recipe, you are going to
do all the cutting and slicing. He, he, he... start with the
onions. We'll need half a piece. Cut it into small pieces. And a tomato
too. You can keep them together if you are really stingy and cannot
afford many bowls (like... say a cookery show).

I'm assuming we are preparing for 2 (But that I'm eating both is a
totally different matter altogether), so take 1 cup of rice. Now
"wash" the rice. It's easy - Pour some running water on the rice, do
some sort of cleaning action with your fingers and drain it off. Do
this 2-3 times, till the water gets clear. Now drain off all the
water.

Take a pan-like vessel. Pour some oil so that it is about 3
millimetres high. Now, put some mustard seeds and cumin seeds. Heat on
medium flame till the mustards starts "popping". Now add your onions
and tomato pieces. Did I remind you to cut potatoes? Of course, I did,
you idiot. Well, one small potato is fine. Keep stirring till the
onions turn slightly golden (or fumes fills the nearby room ;) )

Time for Masala mix. No, not the TV programme. Real masala. It's
roughly like this (all are in tea-spoons):

* 1 spoon turmeric powder
* 2 spoon dhaniya  powder
* 1 spoon masala powder
* 1 spoon red chilly powder
* 3 spoon salt

Keep stirring till the onions looks shrunk (or your roommates starts
coughing in the nearby room). Looks good? Maybe not. It sure tastes
amazing. Not yet, you fool. Just wait some more. For now, transfer it
to a pressure cooker or a large vessel.

If you are cooking in a pressure cooker, use twice as much water as
rice (note to use the same cup you used to measure rice). Close the
cooker and let it cook. If its an open vessel, use thrice as much
water. Stir occasionally to prevent the frothing up effect (not as
cool as it sounds, very messy actually).

Turn off the cooker after you hear three "proper" whistles (as in, not
half whistles or hissing sounds). Or in an open vessel, wait till the
water dries up (or till your roomates start jumping out of the window)

That's it. You were expecting more, right? Sorry, that's all there is
to it.

Tip: Best eaten with Yogurt/Ketchup
