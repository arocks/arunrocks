To borrow phrase from the teen comedy ["The Girl Next Door"](http://www.arunrocks.com/blog/archives/2005/05/06/sin-city-the-girl-next-door-citizen-kane/) for my post's title, last week would be best described as mildly crazy and tonnes of fun. I mean if someone had told me that I would be singing three songs in 3 mins and playing in a funny skit on stage in front of hundreds of people. I would have said, 'No way!' But I did and thoroughly enjoyed it too.

The most common question my friends are asking me now is 'How come you sing so well?' In fact, it has lead me to thinking about writing a short article. This isn't meant to be any motivational crap that is so common in our RSS feeds these days. This article tentatively titled _Developing Artistic Skills You were Never Born With_ is in the works. Meanwhile enjoy your weekend!<!--afd3127874f2e9d9815bfe43972a325b-->
