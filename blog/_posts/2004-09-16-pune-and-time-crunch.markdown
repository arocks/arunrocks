Thanks to Dinky (Dinakar) I have discovered a very effective means of "time pass". The wonderful online community <a href="http://www.orkut.com/">orkut.com</a>. Unfortunately it comes at a time when I work for 14-15 hours everyday. Yes, folks you heard that right. So much for my grand Pune visit right? Well, hope it will stave me away my boredom when I get back to "warming the bench".

A good news for my Mallu readers is that I've made a simple change to my site so that you can see Malayalam text without downloading any extra fonts. Here goes my first line in Mallu:- <strong>
????? ?????? ?????? ???????????? ????????</strong> :))
If you are still seeing gibberish, maybe you should try it on Windows XP (Service Pack 2) or upgrade your IE

My personal project 'Agony' is taking a back seat because of all this. I must say that I'm getting impressed at <a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/group/proj/plclub/contest/ants.html">The International Functional Programming Contest 2004's </a>task description.

That's exactly the way I want Agony to be defined. Mathematically clear. Like Knuth's style in <a href="http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/taocp.html">Art of Computer Programming</a>. Well, need time dudes, need time.

The project I'm happy to say is staying on course due to lot of things committed team members, some good reporting mechanisms and a little magic. The magic is the magic of scripting which is done in VB.Net and <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a>. Both I have initiated. I'm happy to say that by automating we have achieved a Herculean task in a much abbreviated time. I had already realized the importance of scripting, but now the result is for all to see.

I'm planning to move my blog to a better domain (basically non-free), I'm trying out various options in my home town, Thrissur. I hope to use <a href="http://www.blogcms.com">Blog:CMS</a> which I find to have best feature set somewhat matching my requirements. Rest is <a href="http://www.php.net">PHP</a> hacking which I'm pretty comfortable with. I've joined the <a href="http://indianbloggers.blogspot.com/">Indian Bloggers</a> list mainly due to the moderator contacting me spotting me from the Infy Intranet. You gotta see how many Indian bloggers out there. You'll see me there soon.<!--d0bc2756d89da4086c6e83b27b4f343e-->
