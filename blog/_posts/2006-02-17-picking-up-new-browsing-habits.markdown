title: Picking Up New Browsing Habits
wordpress_id: '77'

I have also started tagging my bookmarks on [Technorati](http://del.icio.us/arun_ravindran). I suggest anyone who browses often always faces the problem of transferring their old bookmarks. Also, the problem of bookmarks growing much larger than one's screen height is also a problem ;)

My browsing habits have become more extensive over the last couple of days. Actually, it has just caught up with the times. I mean, we are talking about a generation who has 1324 contacts in their social networking mini-site (i.e. their profile page in a site like www.orkut.com). I have supplemented my news reading with RSS feeds from most major news sites including [Hindu](http://www.hindu.com/rss/01hdline.xml "Hindu's RSS feed"). Other than Slashdot.org, I now also frequent [Digg](http://digg.com/) and [reddit](http://reddit.com/).

All this is thanks to the amazing open source browser [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/central/). Unfortunately for 75% of people out there, Firfox is just a browser that has tabs. But few things which Firefox does, I can't live without is

* Blocks all kinds of ADs and tremendously speeds my browsing experience.
* Having keyboard shortcuts for everything speeds it even more.
* Takes me straight to 'Printer friendly' pages, so no more paging around
* Shows all the downloads in the statusbar

... and much more. Of course all these is because of the [extensions](https://addons.mozilla.org/)

It is so much exciting when websites have sprung up based on simple but strong concepts rather than the all encompassing portal based sites of the dot com days. It is probably what everyone is calling Web 2.0 these days. I welcome this change. Personally, I think has helped budding entrepreneurs like me bring ideas to market thanks to full fledged open source web frameworks like Rails. I have been trying to study [Django](djangoproject.com/) and [Turbogears](turbogears.org/) out there due to my interest in Python (or rather my reluctance to learn Ruby after multiple half hearted attempts).
