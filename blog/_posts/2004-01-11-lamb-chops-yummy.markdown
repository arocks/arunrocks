Yep, it was my treat today, Saturday night. Well, I got through the Infosys, right? It's only fair I give my wards a good treat. Kaizad actually pitched in half. Everyone was there: Badsha, Aakansha, Ashish and Himanshu. It was a lovely dinner. I had lamb chops prepared this way (as in, homely prep) after a long time. Guzzler's Inn was affordable too. We decided that we'll call Mohan kumar one day for our treat. Played carroms well today.<!--44e8e7fce1326fa0da682ba2b42ce40c-->
