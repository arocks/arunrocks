Hi everyone!

As you must have noticed I have upgraded to <a href="http://wordpress.org/development/2006/10/205-ronan/">WordPress 2.0.5 - Ronan</a>  which is hardly a month old now. This is due to an unfortunate technical issue on my hosting provider. I have survived the crash by keeping a backup. But have lost some of the latest posts. So bear with me for a while.... till then, enjoy the new cool look of the site ;)
