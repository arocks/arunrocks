Short Description
--------------------

When you click on the RSS icon in the status bar of Firefox, it
automatically "discovers" some feeds for you. Would you like to see
every category of your blog appear as a seperate feed in Firefox?  If
so activate this plugin. And yes, this is my first Wordpress plugin.

You can see it in action at
[ArunRocks.com](http://www.arunrocks.com/blog/)

How to Install it?
--------------------

These are pretty standard.

1. Download [livemarks-0.5.zip][1]. There are no additional required libraries

2. Copy the livemarks.php file to your plugins folder at `\wp-content\plugins`

3. Go to the plugins admin page and activate it

4. There is no step 4! ;)

Full Description
--------------------

Users of the Firefox and Opera browsers would familiar with live
bookmarks or livemarks. This is a browser's in built mechanism to keep
track of any site's RSS feeds. For eg: in firefox, an RSS icon appears
in the status bar, clicking on which will display a menu of feeds
automatically "discovered" by it. Wordpress blogs will automatically
have two feeds (varies with the template) - an Atom feed and an RSS
feed.  This plugin tries to add the following to your list of of
"discovered" feeds -

1. Every category of your blog appear as a seperate feed in Firefox if
   you are at your blog's home page

2. The relevant category of a post will appear if you are visiting a
   particular post

3. The comments feed of your blog

I have a problem!
