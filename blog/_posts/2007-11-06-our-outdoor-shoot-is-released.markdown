title: Our Outdoor Shoot is Released!

Well, well... have I been busy ;) All this while I have been wondering about the long overdue Role change and when it finally happens, I'm still wondering what's the big deal... <sigh> Ignore maadi.

Most wedding albums in Kerala at least have a (partly film songs inspired) outdoor shoot. The locations are traditionally the nearby paddy field or some overgrowth of trees.

Our outdoor shoot isn't very different, but hopefully done more tastefully. The locations are places around my hometown, Thrissur like Nehru Park and Velingankunnu. The camerawork was done by Sudheep. Direction by him and yours truly. Click on more to see the video and do write in your comments....
