A big colourful cloud filled with happiness and energy. Thats how that last ten days felt like. Being a prisoner of monotony of work, this break was my parole. Just enough to breathe life into my dying creative thoughts.

Four extremely long bus journeys which afford sleep in semi-recliner position gave me enough time to mull over my pet project. I realized that the MMORPG is just an approximate term for something I have in mind. Role-Playing be it text based or graphical is only <a href="http://www.corante.com/gotgame/archives/a_new_kind_of_game.php">as interesting as the environment</a>. The environment I have in mind is hardly original  <strong>Ancient India</strong>. Carrying the tradition of RPGs we could invent (or rather discover) races such as Rishis (similar to wizards), Devas (no analogy, except say Elves) or Asuras (say Orcs?). I really dont know if this would appeal to our audience. This concept is helpful to differentiate participants by trying to identify them with a sub-culture. We, Indians, I daresay already co-exist with different sub-cultures. Its a debatable question. On a more practical note it tends to provide repeat playability.

I would like to clarify that my pet project named Agony will essentially involve sub-plots and multi-linear gameplay. In my personal opinion, purely immersive playing with infinitesimal pathways can get quickly boring. This would also mean that we get to <a href="http://www.corante.com/gotgame/archives/i_saw_god_and_i_killed_it.php">make a universe with its own physics/economic laws</a>  and a decent storyline. And lest do I forget, engaging 3D graphics (no we are not recreating "The Matrix" here ;) ). The biggest giveaway would be the creator mode in which you can perform level editing. Not having played a single MMORPG myself, I do not know if any game server supports this. But to me, game servers are nothing but persistent finite state machines. This makes them suitable for rapid prototyping of user-made levels. This is one experiment which I would definitely try out.

Regular readers of my blog would notice that my research is slowly creeping into my regular blogs. This is was not forced and it seems <a href="http://www.corante.com/many/archives/2004/11/11/on_the_academictechnical_divide_in_social_computing.php#more">it is far more common than I had imagined</a>.

Time to switch to other more worldly matters. The organization in which I did my NGO project <a href="http://www.janasevasisubhavan.org/">Janaseva Sisubhavan</a> (designed by me :) ) is getting greater media attention than ever. NGO project is basically a part of my MBA programme in TAPMI involving social work. It must be one of the most important organizations in social work in Kerala. I promise to add more pictures of Kerala in my <a href="http://www.arunrocks.com/gallery/">gallery </a>soon.<!--57c52877350e743b8811839f21dc584a-->
