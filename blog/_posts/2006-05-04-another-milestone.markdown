Yesterday, I completed 2 years in my present company, Infosys Technologies Ltd. I realized this while I was in the bus, traveling to the office. Two years, in IT industry years, is like a decade. I decided to immediately fire a mail to all my induction program batchmates. Loads of replies came and we found ourselves catching up with what has been happening over the last couple of months.

Yesterday, was another important date. I (and three of my roommates) shifted to a gorgeous new apartment within Mangala Enclave. This is my third apartment in the last 2 months (Mathias and His Grace being the earlier ones). All three apartments have been in the fifth floor. At this rate I might even surpass my earlier record of four transfers in three months during my initial years in Infy ;) !

Oh, an update on me would be incomplete without a mention of my latest technological "investment". I bought a camera tripod. Lately, I have been dissatisfied with my skills in portrait photography. Despite being the field I'm most interested in, you feel quite limited without a tripod because my 350D lacks image stabilization. Posting self shot pictures, judge them yourselves!!!
