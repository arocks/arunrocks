### Code

`<code>` spans are delimited
by backticks.

You can include literal backticks
like `` `this` ``.

This is a normal paragraph:

{% highlight python %}
    This is a preformatted
    code block.
{% endhighlight %}

Preceded by a space, the colon
disappears. :

    This is a preformatted
    code block.
    
### Manual Line Breaks

End a line with two or more spaces:
Roses are red,  
Violets are blue.
