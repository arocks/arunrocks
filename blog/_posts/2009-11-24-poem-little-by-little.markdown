### Little by little

Soft pink tiny hands  
Thump, thump... thump, thump  
Travel to unexplored lands  
Thump, thump... thump, thump  

A gingerly turn  
A confident roll  
Ebbing everywhere  
Her ropey drool  

Bangled hands on plastic chairs  
Tap, tap.... tap, tap  
Music to her little ears  
Tap, tap.... tap, tap  

Kitten eyes  
On a sorry face  
When I sigh  
upon a broken vase  

Grandfather clock smiling above  
Tick, tock... tick, tock  
She smiles back beaming with love  
Tick, tock.... tick, tock
