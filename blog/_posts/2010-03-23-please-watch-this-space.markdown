Please watch this space for more information....

<div style="border: 2px dashed black; width: 400px; height: 300px;">&nbsp;</div>

Of course, after a certain amount time, you will notice a slight flicker in this generous whitespace devoid of any tangible information. Given the time and effort spent in your unwavering gaze, much later, the flicker will multiply into various coloured dots. These dots are a temporary phenomenon called retinal tear.

But please do continue watching the space. Your answer will reveal in a couple of hours when you hear muffled giggles from the corner of your eyes. This means you have kept yourself still long enough to warrant attention from your colleagues. You have become an imminent and potentially future source of subversive humour. Let this insight not detract you from your current task at hand. Please continue watching the space.

The passage of time might seem glacial, but it might have been only a few days elapsed since you embarked on this endeavour. The strange tickling sensations tracing a halo-like pattern around the crown of your head might be cobwebs-in-the-making by some opportunistic spiders. The occasional shrill noises at night might not be the usual crickets after all, but little rats ogling at you. The pithy tch, tch from the ceiling might be the most patient audience of them all, the stunned household lizards. They produce these sounds only when they are amazed at some still life which rival their own stillness, out of pure jealously, obviously. However, the good news is that the worst is probably over. So, please continue watching this space.

In the midst of all this, please do not be surprised, if the prolonged presence of the white'space' burnt a hole on your LCD screen. This is perfectly natural and probably for the better. You will now have the unrestricted viewing pleasure of an actual space right in the middle of your screen. This is a real 'window' and gladly enough, cannot be closed or minimized by any means. This is wonderful news for a patient observer like you. So, please continue watching this space.

In the meanwhile, the human race which, in evolutionary terms, quite recently got an upgrade from their always quibbling, tree jumping cousins, would have found themselves engaged in a major war of some kind. As a non-participant to this frivolous event, you would probably be quite indifferent to the comical sounding sirens around your place.

Suddenly through the little window you have been gazing, somewhere in the distance, you might notice a bellowing angry red mushroom cloud. This might be accompanied by a brilliant bright flash of light. But...

Please, please continue watching this space!
