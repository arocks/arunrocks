The new looks of the site can be credited to the awesome wordpress plugin <a title="K@" href="http://getk2.com/2006/08/k2-09-release/">K2</a>. It handles AJAX search box at the right column (try it out now :) ), rotates the ArunRocks banner with every page refresh with the pictures that I have shot and of course it has a list of my favourite links at the sidebar.

<img align="left" title="ArunRocks Logo" id="image95" alt="ArunRocks Logo" src="/blog/img/arunrocks-logo.jpg" />  

Of course, banners are not the only artwork that I did. In fact, I have been thinking about having a cool logo for ArunRocks for sometime now. Something a bit symbolic yet not too abstract. So I kind of thought about the name a bit and came up with the one on the left in about 15 mins on Photoshop.

Try to guess what the logo stands for before you read ahead. The inverted music symbol obviously stands for the two 'r's (in small letters) in arunrocks.  If you haven't noticed already Arun Rocks clearly hints at my initials. So the double 'r's have a double interpretation here. The letters are tilted and obviously 'rocking'. The red background is also inspired from the same 'Rock' theme. This appears as the icon of this site on your browser, also called the <a title="What is a Favicon?" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Favicon">favicon</a>
