Thanks to everyone who enjoyed and commented on my talk today titled 'Accelerate Your Game Development with Pyglet'. I am happy to see so much enthusiasm within the python community for game development. This was my first lightning talk (and the first one for the day as well) and though, I slightly overshot the timelimit, it was a great experience.

The talk was about creating a simple casual game using Pyglet called 'FruitCatch'. The source code is really small and very readable. I also compared Pyglet with Pygame and why I prefer Pyglet (in certain situations:)). The demo showed the working game in the end.

You can download the [game source code][gamesrc] and [presentation slides (PDF)][gameslides] here. I've shared this with the organisers as well, so it will be put up at the [Pycon](http://in.pycon.org/) site as well
