Hope all of you had a fab weekend. Mine was a little more interesting
this time. Almost all of our last week was spent setting up our new
apartment in Ladyhill. This week some of us TAPMIians had our good ‘ol
Homecoming. Actually more of old than good. However I thought it’s a
great idea to take Vidya along to show where I scrammed around for two
years.

There was a party/culturals and it was pretty obvious that the no: of
engineers in the current batch of students have shot up, right upto
the level of saturation. Not the grooviest night out I have had, I’ve
got to say.

The best part was, of course, Manipal. End-point is still the best place to
kick start your romance (and to end them abruptly ;) ). KMC greens,
with its curvy beauties, is still the best place to remind you that
grass is always greener on the other side. Not to forget the boozer’s
paradise – Shackpoint is now relocated to a less deserted area. Except
for that, every pothole is very much where we had left it.


Some pics which we took over the weekend:
