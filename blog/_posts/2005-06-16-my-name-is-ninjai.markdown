I have just discovered this exceptionally artistic indie film called [Ninjai][1]. It would be without doubt the best movie in [Flash][6] I have ever seen. In fact, its fan following has become so huge that it is more than a movie, it is a [game][2], DVD etc. It is hard to belive that it is created by a group of [stunt men][3] called The Ninjai Gang in their spare time. They say they made it for themselves. A true artist makes a great creation only when he/she makes it self satisfying. I strongly believe in that.

It has an incredible soundtrack and excellent music. Here is the trailer:

So, why don't [see it][4] for yourself?

Note: With every chapter it gets progressively voilent and the story is very addictive. So don't tell that I didn't warn ya.... :)
