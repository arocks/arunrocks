I have wondered how one word descriptions would go for certain people. Let's start with easy ones:

A footballer is a person who plays football
A fisherman is a person who catches fish
A comedian is a person who acts comically
AndÂ….
Arun Ravindran is a person who always keeps reading

Well, this profound insight can be easily proven if you know my daily routine. The moment my mecum covered eyes crack open late morning, I fumble for my mobile phone to <em>read </em>the time. At the station, I <em>read </em>the next available train timing. I <em>read </em>Metro while traveling in the tube. Once I'm at office, I spend almost all my time <em>read</em>ing numerous documents either on my PC or printouts. As a persistent hangover from my days on bench (a term for no project assigned), I <em>read</em>/browse hundreds of web pages for news and trivia. Thanks to the huge void in my life brought by the absence of a TV (fondly referred to as telly in the UK), I spend my time creatively <em>read</em>ing books or Sunday supplements.

Now that you know what kind of creature I am, it must come as no surprise to you that I have managed to get a library membership in London. Jason Goode, a really friendly guy in my office, managed to lead me into the maze called Barbican Center. The membership was free and one can take up to 12 books for 3 weeks. You can reissue by phone up to 3 times. Though lacking in the technology section, it was well stacked in varied fields of art. I spend many delightful moments discovering sections unheard of such as Paranormal Studies, Videography etc. I managed to find 2 books on photography. Owing to their picture-book format, I have lapped them up in no time. As a strange consequence, I now find myself reading more information in every photograph I put my eyes on. Seems some creatures never change, they just evolve ;)<!--851954e83b775d00b4eee5854aafc9fd--><!--7c80c7958710fa3b6314448017e5a0cc-->
